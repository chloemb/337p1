To run our project, first run: pip3 install -r requirements.txt
Next, run pre_ceremony() in gg_api.py
Next, run gg_api.py. Type '2013', '2015', or 'c', depending on which years you want to run.
This will generate file: human_readable_year.txt, which has our answers as well as our additional goals.
You can also run autograder.py to test our 2013 and 2015 results with the autograder.
